Assam continues to face an alarming crisis in its education system — one that directly threatens its social and economic progress. With dropout rates far above the national average, particularly at the secondary level, the state is falling short of its National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 target of achieving 100% Gross Enrolment Ratio (GER) by 2030.

**Key Numbers (2023–24)**:
**•	Secondary Level Dropout Rate:** 19.46% (2nd highest in India; Bihar leads with 20.86%)
**•	Middle Level (Classes 6–8):** 8.16% (4th highest nationally)
**•	Completion Rates:** Boys – 57.4%, Girls – 63.7% (both declined since 2019)

**Why Are Students Dropping Out?**

**The causes are multi-layered:**
**•	Economic Strain:** Families, especially in tea garden and minority regions, cannot afford school-related expenses. Boys often leave to earn.
**•	Social Pressures:** Early marriage and domestic responsibilities push girls out of classrooms.
**•	Geographic Hurdles:** Remote areas like char lands and South Salmara lack nearby schools or transport facilities.
**•	Systemic Weaknesses:** Poor infrastructure, understaffed schools, and pandemic aftershocks have exacerbated the problem.

**Government Action:**
In July 2025, the Krishna Baruah Committee was formed to study and address dropout patterns by class, gender, and region. Its findings will guide policies to curb the crisis.

**Proposed Solutions:**
**•	Incentivized Schemes (like Nijut Moina):** Financial aid to retain students.
**•	Infrastructure Development:** More schools, digital access, and teacher recruitment.
**•	Community Engagement:** Campaigns to tackle early marriage and share domestic burdens.

**3. Hahila Beel: Assam’s Forgotten Natural and Cultural Treasure**
Located in Assam’s Goalpara district, Hahila Beel (often misrecorded as Hasila Beel) is more than a wetland—it is a historical, cultural, and ecological heritage site that has sadly been neglected.

**Ecological Importance:**
**•	Size:** 245 hectares, larger than Guwahati’s Deepor Beel
**•	Biodiversity:** Once home to swans and migratory birds
**•	Flood Management:** Acts as a natural buffer during monsoons
**•	Water Balance:** Supports local ecosystems through nutrient cycling

**Cultural Significance:**
•	Revered as a sacred place of quiet prayers and rituals
•	Supported fishing communities for generations
•	Associated with myths, including a legendary submerged iron chain

**Challenges:**
Encroachment and degradation have stripped the beel of its wildlife and cultural spirit. Conservation is urgently needed to revive both the ecosystem and community connection.

**Potential Mains Questions:**
•	What is the ecological and cultural significance of Hahila Beel?
•	How can Assam balance eco-tourism and conservation in Goalpara?

**4. Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) Scheme: Boosting Jobs & Formalization**
As part of Budget 2024–25’s Jobs and Skills Package, the Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) Scheme aims to create formal jobs by supporting both employees and employers.

**•	Incentive:** ₹15,000 wage subsidy in 2 installments

•	Incentives: ₹1,000 to ₹3,000/month per new employee for 2 years (4 years for manufacturing)
•	Payment: Directly to employer's PAN-linked bank account

**5. Digital India 2025: A Decade of Transformation**
